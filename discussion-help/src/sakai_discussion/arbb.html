<h2>Creating/adding or deleting a discussion
topic</h2>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>. To view a list of permissions
associated with a given role, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=armh">Permissions, roles, and tools</a>. For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and Roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>To create/add or delete a discussion topic, in your site's
<a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> click <strong><code>Discussion</code></strong>, and then follow the
appropriate steps below:</p>

<h3>Creating/adding a discussion topic</h3>

<ol><li>Click <strong><code>Add Topic</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Enter information about your discussion topic in the fields on the
form; an asterisk indicates a field is required. You can choose a
category for your discussion topic from the drop-down list if there is
one, or create a custom one.<br /><br />
</li><li>To limit replies to only the top-level post (i.e., your initial
post), select the <strong><code>Within this topic, only allow replies directly
to this message</code></strong> radio button. This option will create a "flat"
discussion. If you would rather choose to allow replies to any posts,
select <strong><code>Within this topic, allow replies to any
message</code></strong>. Selecting this option will create a "threaded"
discussion, which is by nature more interactive because users are able
to reply to a reply. Flat discussions, in contrast, tend to be more
structured and for this reason are more easily controlled.

<br /><br />
</li><li>If you wish to add an attachment, follow these steps:<br /><br />




<ol><li>Click <strong><code>Add attachments</code></strong>.
</li><li>You can add any number of attachments, and they can be any
combination of local files, websites, and resources:

<br /><br />

<ul><li>To attach a local file from your computer, under "Upload local
file", either enter a filename in the box provided or click
<strong><code>Browse...Â </code></strong>. Once you find the file, select it and click
<strong><code>Open</code></strong>.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When attaching a file, you must include the
file's extension (e.g., <code>.gif</code>, <code>.doc</code>,
<code>.html</code>, or <code>.jpg</code>). If you do not, anyone who
attempts to display or download the file will get an error
message.</p>
</li><li>To attach a URL, under "URL (link to website)", type
the URL in the box provided.
</li><li>To attach an item from the Resources section of your site, under
"Select a resource", click <strong><code>Attach a copy</code></strong> next to the
resource(s) you want to attach.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can attach files from another site to
which you belong, provided that the files are set to be viewable by
people outside the source site. To browse for files in other sites,
click <strong><code>Show other sites</code></strong>.</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>When you've selected all the items you want to attach, click
 <strong><code>Finish</code></strong>.
</li></ol>





<br />
</li><li>You can either save a draft (<strong><code>Save Draft</code></strong>) of your entry or
post the topic to the discussion (<strong><code>Add Topic</code></strong>). If you save it as
a draft, it will show up in the list with other discussion items, but
will be marked as a draft and will be visible only to you, the author.</li></ol>



<h3>Deleting a discussion topic</h3>

<p>
To delete a discussion topic, click the trash can icon next to the
topic you wish to delete. When asked to confirm that you wish to
delete the topic, click <strong><code>Delete Topic</code></strong>.

</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The absence of the trash can icon means that
you don't have permission to delete the message.</p>
