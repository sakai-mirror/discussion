<h2>Creating/adding or deleting a discussion
topic</h2>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>. To view a list of permissions
associated with a given role, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=armh">Permissions, roles, and tools</a>. For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and Roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>To create/add or delete a discussion topic, in your site's
<a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> click <strong><code>Discussion</code></strong>, and then follow the
appropriate steps below:</p>

<h3>Creating/adding a discussion topic</h3>

<ol><li>Click <strong><code>Add Topic</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Enter information about your discussion topic in the fields on the
form; an asterisk indicates a field is required. You can choose a
category for your discussion topic from the drop-down list if there is
one, or create a custom one.<br /><br />
</li><li>To limit replies to only the top-level post (i.e., your initial
post), select the <strong><code>Within this topic, only allow replies directly
to this message</code></strong> radio button. This option will create a "flat"
discussion. If you would rather choose to allow replies to any posts,
select <strong><code>Within this topic, allow replies to any
message</code></strong>. Selecting this option will create a "threaded"
discussion, which is by nature more interactive because users are able
to reply to a reply. Flat discussions, in contrast, tend to be more
structured and for this reason are more easily controlled.

<br /><br />
</li><li>If you wish to add an attachment, follow these steps:<br /><br />




<ol><li>Click <strong><code>Add Attachments</code></strong>. (If there are already attachments, you will see <strong><code>Add/remove Attachments</code></strong> instead.)
</li><li>You can add any number of attachments, and they can be any
combination of local files, websites, and resources:

<br /><br />

<ul><li>To attach a local file from your computer, under "Upload local
file", you can either enter a path to the file, or click
<strong><code>Browse</code></strong> to find and select the file on your computer.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must include the file's extension (e.g.,
<code>.gif</code>, <code>.doc</code>, <code>.html</code>, or
<code>.jpg</code>). If you don't, anyone who attempts to access the
file will get an error message.</p>
</li><li>To attach a URL, under "URL (link to website)", type the URL in
the box provided, and then click <strong><code>Add</code></strong>.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You do not need to include the
<code>http://</code> when you type the URL.</p>
</li><li>To attach an item from Resources, under "Select a resource", click
<strong><code>Attach a copy</code></strong> next to the file you want to add.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can attach a file from one of your other
sites (including your <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My Workspace</a> area), provided the
file's Access properties are set <strong><code>Display to non-members (publicly
viewable)</code></strong>. To browse for files in other sites, click <strong><code>Show
other sites</code></strong>.</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>As you add attachments, they appear in a list under "Items to
attach". When you've selected all the files, websites, and Resource
items you wish to attach, review this list, and click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong>
if there are any errors.
</li><li>When you're finished, at the bottom of the screen, click
<strong><code>Continue</code></strong>. You should see your file, website, or Resources
item listed under "Attachments".
</li></ol>





<br />
</li><li>You can either save a draft (<strong><code>Save Draft</code></strong>) of your entry or
post the topic to the discussion (<strong><code>Add Topic</code></strong>). If you save it as
a draft, it will show up in the list with other discussion items, but
will be marked as a draft and will be visible only to you, the author.</li></ol>



<h3>Deleting a discussion topic</h3>

<p>
To delete a discussion topic, click the trash can icon next to the
topic you wish to delete. When asked to confirm that you wish to
delete the topic, click <strong><code>Delete Topic</code></strong>.

</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The absence of the trash can icon means that
you don't have permission to delete the message.</p>
