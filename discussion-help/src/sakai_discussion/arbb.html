<h2>Creating/adding or deleting a discussion
topic</h2>
<p>To create/add or delete a discussion topic, in your site's
<a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> click <strong><code>Discussion</code></strong>, and then follow the
appropriate steps below:</p>

<h3>Creating/adding a discussion topic</h3>

<ol><li>Click <strong><code>Add Topic</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Enter information about your discussion topic in the fields on the
form; an asterisk indicates a field is required. You can choose a
category for your discussion topic from the drop-down list if there is
one, or create a custom one.<br /><br />
</li><li>To limit replies to only the top-level post (i.e., your initial
post), select the <strong><code>Within this topic, only allow replies directly
to this message</code></strong> radio button. This option will create a "flat"
discussion. If you would rather choose to allow replies to any posts,
select <strong><code>Within this topic, allow replies to any
message</code></strong>. Selecting this option will create a "threaded"
discussion, which is by nature more interactive because users are able
to reply to a reply. Flat discussions, in contrast, tend to be more
structured and for this reason are more easily controlled.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Attachments", you can attach a file from your local
computer or from Resources, or specify the URL for a file on the
web. For instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aupf">Options for adding attachments</a>.<br /><br />

</li><li>You can either save a draft (<strong><code>Save Draft</code></strong>) of your entry or
post the topic to the discussion (<strong><code>Add Topic</code></strong>). If you save it as
a draft, it will show up in the list with other discussion items, but
will be marked as a draft and will be visible only to you, the author.</li></ol>



<h3>Deleting a discussion topic</h3>

<p>
To delete a discussion topic, click the trash can icon next to the
topic you wish to delete. When asked to confirm that you wish to
delete the topic, click <strong><code>Delete Topic</code></strong>.

</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The absence of the trash can icon means that
you don't have permission to delete the message.</p>
