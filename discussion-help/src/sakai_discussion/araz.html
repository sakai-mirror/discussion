<h2>Replying to a discussion item</h2>


<p>To reply to a discussion item (e.g., topic or reply), follow these steps:</p>

<ol><li>In your site's <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>, click <strong><code>Discussion</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>From the list of discussion topics, click the title of the topic
or post to which you would like to reply. A green arrow will appear to
the left of the item to indicate it's the one you've selected and it will
open at the bottom of the page.


<p>Use the black arrows on the left to expand and collapse discussion
items. If you click an arrow pointing right, you will expand the item
to view topics and/or replies. Click a downward-pointing arrow to
collapse a list.</p>
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Reply to Message</code></strong> or <strong><code>Reply to Topic</code></strong> (you
may need to scroll down to see the <strong><code>Reply</code></strong> button).

<br /><br />
</li><li>Complete the "New Reply" form; required fields are marked with an asterisk.

<br /><br />
</li><li>If you would like to add an attachment, follow these steps:
<br /><br />




<ol><li>Click <strong><code>Add Attachments</code></strong>. (If there are already attachments, you will see <strong><code>Add/remove Attachments</code></strong> instead.)
</li><li>You can add any number of attachments, and they can be any
combination of local files, websites, and resources:

<br /><br />

<ul><li>To attach a local file from your computer, under "Upload local
file", you can either enter a path to the file, or click
<strong><code>Browse</code></strong> to find and select the file on your computer.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must include the file's extension (e.g.,
<code>.gif</code>, <code>.doc</code>, <code>.html</code>, or
<code>.jpg</code>). If you don't, anyone who attempts to access the
file will get an error message.</p>
</li><li>To attach a URL, under "URL (link to website)", type the URL in
the box provided, and then click <strong><code>Add</code></strong>.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You do not need to include the
<code>http://</code> when you type the URL.</p>
</li><li>To attach an item from Resources, under "Select a resource", click
<strong><code>Attach a copy</code></strong> next to the file you want to add.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can attach a file from one of your other
sites (including your <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My Workspace</a> area), provided the
file's Access properties are set <strong><code>Display to non-members (publicly
viewable)</code></strong>. To browse for files in other sites, click <strong><code>Show
other sites</code></strong>.</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>As you add attachments, they appear in a list under "Items to
attach". When you've selected all the files, websites, and Resource
items you wish to attach, review this list, and click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong>
if there are any errors.
</li><li>When you're finished, at the bottom of the screen, click
<strong><code>Continue</code></strong>. You should see your file, website, or Resources
item listed under "Attachments".
</li></ol>






<br />
</li><li>Using the buttons at the bottom of the screen, you can post your
reply (<strong><code>Add Reply</code></strong>), preview it (<strong><code>Preview</code></strong>), save it as
a draft (<strong><code>Save Draft</code></strong>), or cancel your posting
(<strong><code>Cancel</code></strong>).
</li></ol>
